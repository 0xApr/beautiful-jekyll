My name is Apaar. I am a regular guy and an introvert who prefer to spen majority of his time with computers, networks and cables. This blog is all about my discoveries doing such stuff. I consider and call myself a **Geek**, rather just another **Geek**.

Topics which matter me :
- Information/Cyber Security and Forensics
- Computer Networks
- Web Application Testing
- Web Development
- Free and Open Source Software (Linux/GNU, BSDs, etc.)
- Android and Smartphones
- Bug Bounties, Cats and more
